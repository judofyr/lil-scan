## Error message presentation

image::https://judofyr.github.io/lil-scan/images/rust-example1.png[]

A core principle for the presentation of error message is *progressive enhancement*.
In the middle of this error message you will find this part:

```
Error E0080 in src/test/compile-fail/E0080.rs:12:3
Attempt to shift left with overflow.
```

This is _actually_ the full error message.
Everything around is just additional information which helps you understand the error message quicker. 
The simple error presentation is useful in itself:

- If you're sharing the error message with someone else then you only need these two lines.
  We reduce the chance they someone unintentionally shares an error message without the critical information.
- Outside of a terminal (in logs or error reporting systems) this is a very efficient way of displaying the information.

By always showing the simple error presentation _together_ with the expanded one we slowly teach the user about the format.
They don't have to guess what the numbers ("what is `:12:3`?") mean since we explain it in full words ("oh, it's the line number").

In addition, we're following these stylistic principles:

- *Most important information furthest down:*
  Terminals are a bit strange in that they print information bottom-up:
  The newest information appears at the bottom and pushes the previous information up.
  A user will naturally read a terminal bottom-up,
  typically scanning for "where did this command _start_" and read from there.
  The _actual_ error message section is therefore placed at the bottom while additional information comes further up.
- *Connecting sections together:*
  The terminal itself makes it surprisingly hard to group relevant information together.
  We add our own border so that the user quickly understand.
  This is particularly important when multiple errors are shown.
- *Predictable placement:*
  If possible, we place elements such that they will appear in that spot for _all_ error messages.
  The length of the filename, the shape of the source code, and even the width of the line numbers will notably _not_ impact any other element.
- *Careful use of colors:*
  Colors are a great way of drawing attention and we use them sparingly to draw attention to a _specific_ area:
  They are the quick way of finding the different sections of an error message.
  Bright colors are therefore _only_ used in the section title.
  This combines well with the premise of "users read a terminal bottom-up".
  You can read bottom-up until you find a colored line and then you've identified a full section.
- *Capitalization, punctuation and prepositions:*
  Many systems tend to use lowercase-only messages and special symbols to group things together (e.g. square brackets).
  We see no reason to _not_ follow regular English conventions.
  Capitals signal the start of a new sentence and the period marks the end.
  These help the user quickly scan the sentences.
  Prepositions such as "of" and "in" are both short _and_ convey meaning.
